# 🌧️ Rain Prediction Using Logistic Regression

This project builds a **Logistic Regression model** to predict whether it will rain tomorrow using Australian weather data.  
The project covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and making predictions on new inputs.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Preprocesses real-world weather data (missing values, scaling, encoding)
- Splits data into training, validation, and test sets
- Trains a **Logistic Regression** classifier using `scikit-learn`
- Evaluates performance using **accuracy** and a **confusion matrix heatmap**
- Saves the trained model and preprocessing pipeline
- Makes predictions on new weather data inputs
